## Access

### GitHub organization
Please contact me at hi@dandevri.es to request access for this GitHub organization. After approval from &samhoud I will add you as a **member of the &samhoudmedia organization**.

### Bitbucket
Due to content of the 360-video's (needed to be kept private) they are hosted on the Bitbucket platform since GitHub requires payment for private repo's. 

After approval of &samhoud please contact me at hi@dandevri.es to get the credentials of the **bitbucket account**. There you will have access to the private repo's.

## Hosting
All prototypes are hosted via [`GitHub Pages`](https://pages.github.com/) to serve up the static files. These repositories have a `gh-pages` branch and have the url for the live version at the top of the repository. The 360-video's are hosted in the same manner but on [`BitBucket Cloud`](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/publishing-a-website-on-bitbucket-cloud-221449776.html). 

The showcase repository is a dynamic node app so it is deployed to a `node` environment on [`Heroku`](heroku.com). With Heroku you can have a free tier with a custom domain.
